<title>New York Times Columnist Falls Prey to Signal Repeater Car Burglary</title>

<description><![CDATA[<p class="byline"> <a href="mailto:spowell@climafy.com">Phoenix666</a> writes:</p><p>A NY Times columnist had his car stolen by kids who were possibly <a href="http://arstechnica.com/cars/2015/04/new-york-times-columnist-falls-prey-to-signal-repeater-car-burglary/">using a repeater to rebroadcast his key fob</a>:</p><blockquote><div><p>Keyless entry systems typically only communicate with their remote fobs over the distance of a few feet, but he thinks that the gadget is capable of extending this range, fooling the car into thinking that the remote is within range even though it was actually in Bilton's House, about 50 feet away. He arrived at this theory after he consulted with Boris Danev, a Swiss-based security expert:</p><p>"It's a bit like a loudspeaker, so when you say hello over it, people who are 100 meters away can hear the word, 'hello,'" Mr. Danev said. "You can buy these devices anywhere for under $100." He said some of the lower-range devices cost as little as $17 and can be bought online on sites like eBay, Amazon and Craigslist.</p></div></blockquote><p>Sounds creative and easy.

<title>WikiLeaks Publishes &#x22;The Sony Archives&#x22;</title>
<link>https://soylentnews.org/article.pl?sid=15/04/17/1236248&amp;from=rss</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p class="byline"> <a href="//soylentnews.org/~takyon/">takyon</a> writes:</p><p>WikiLeaks has <a href="https://wikileaks.org/sony/press/">published</a> "The Sony Archives," a searchable database containing 30,287 <a href="https://wikileaks.org/sony/docs/">documents</a> and 173,132 <a href="https://wikileaks.org/sony/emails/">emails</a> leaked from Sony Pictures Entertainment (SPE). The WikiLeaks press release portrays the archive as newsworthy and in the public interest:</p><blockquote><div><p>WikiLeaks editor-in-chief Julian Assange said: "This archive shows the inner workings of an influential multinational corporation. It is newsworthy and at the centre of a geo-political conflict. It belongs in the public domain. WikiLeaks will ensure it stays there."<br> <br>Sony is a member of the MPAA and a strong lobbyist on issues around internet policy, piracy, trade agreements and copyright issues. The emails show the back and forth on lobbying and political efforts, not only with the MPAA but with politicians directly. In November 2013 WikiLeaks published a secret draft of the <a href="https://wikileaks.org/tpp">Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) IP Chapter</a>. The Sony Archives show <a href="https://wikileaks.org/sony/emails/emailid/108915">SPE's internal reactions</a>, including discussing the impact with Michael Froman, the US Trade Representative. It also references the case against Megaupload and the extradition of its founder Kim DotCom from New Zealand as part of SPE's war on piracy.<br> <br>The connections and alignments between Sony Pictures Entertainment and the US Democratic Party are detailed through the archives, including SPE's CEO Lynton attending dinner with President Obama at Martha's Vineyard and Sony employees being part of fundraising dinners for the Democratic Party. There are emails <a href="https://wikileaks.org/sony/emails/emailid/135225">setting up a collective</a> within the corporation to get around the 5,000 USD limit on corporate campaign donations to give 50,000 USD to get the Democratic New York Governor Andrew Cuomo elected as "<a href="https://wikileaks.org/sony/emails/emailid/49813">Thanks to Governor Cuomo, we have a great production incentive environment in NY and a strong piracy advocate that’s actually done more than talk about our problems.</a>"<br> <br>Sony Pictures Entertainment CEO Michael Lynton is on the board of trustees of RAND Corporation, an organisation specialising in research and development for the United States military and intelligence sector. The Sony Archives show the flow of contacts and information between these two major US industries, whether it is RAND wanting to invite George Clooney and Kevin Spacey to events, or Lynton offering contact to Valerie Jarrett (a close advisor to Obama) or RAND desiring a partnership with IMAX for digital archiving. With this close tie to the military-industrial complex it is no surprise that Sony reached out to RAND for advice regarding its North Korea film The Interview. RAND provided an analyst specialised in North Korea and suggested Sony <a href="https://wikileaks.org/sony/emails/emailid/12886">reach out to the State Department and the NSA</a> regarding North Korea's complaints about the upcoming film. The Sony documents also show Sony being in possession of a brochure for an NSA-evaluated online cloud security set-up called <a href="https://wikileaks.org/sony/docs/05/docs/Cloud/INTEGRITY%20Private%20Cloud%20Solution%20Profile%20May%202011.pdf">INTEGRITY</a>.</p></div></blockquote><p>Additional coverage at <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-32343268">BBC</a> and <a href="http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-wikileaks-sony-hack-20150416-story.html">LA Times</a>. Sony has condemned the document dump:</p><blockquote><div><p>"The attackers used the dissemination of stolen information to try to harm SPE and its employees, and now WikiLeaks regrettably is assisting them in that effort," said a Sony Pictures spokesperson in a statement. "We vehemently disagree with WikiLeaks' assertion that this material belongs in the public domain and will continue to fight for the safety, security, and privacy of our company and its more than 6,000 employees."</p></div></blockquote><p><a href="https://soylentnews.org/article.pl?sid=15/04/17/1236248&amp;from=rss">Read more of this story</a> at SoylentNews.</p>]]></description>

<title>Real Vegan Cheese: Coming From a Yeast to You</title>
<link>https://soylentnews.org/article.pl?sid=15/04/17/1128204&amp;from=rss</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p class="byline"> <a href="//soylentnews.org/~takyon/">takyon</a> writes:</p><p>Wired has a <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/04/diy-biotech-vegan-cheese/">profile</a> of <a href="https://realvegancheese.org/">"Real Vegan Cheese"</a>, a product emerging from <a href="https://counterculturelabs.org/">Counter Culture Labs</a> in Oakland, California. The <a href="https://wiki.hackerspaces.org/List_of_Hacker_Spaces">DIY/biotech lab</a> is using genetically modified yeast cells to produce 11 proteins normally found in cow's milk, which can then be used to create synthetic cheese.</p><p>The genetic engineering approach to cheese has been enabled by the rapidly falling cost of DNA synthesis. It now costs less than $0.25 per base pair to obtain a custom DNA sequence which can be delivered by mail. Why make vegan cheese using yeast? Cheesemaking is an artisanal process with centuries of history and one of the earliest examples of human-directed microbiology. Existing plant-based vegan cheeses can't reproduce the casein proteins needed to achieve a passable cheese. However, Real Vegan Cheese will not use animal fat or lactose.</p><p>The process is not limited to bovine cheese:</p><blockquote><div><p>When I visit the lab, I discover the cheese team includes a biologist, a bioethicist, a retired clinical psychologist, an accountant, and a former Apple marketer. "This to me is a natural extension of computer culture," says Maria Chavez, the ex-Apple employee and a leader of the vegan cheese project. "What is bigger to hack than our bodies and our environment? It's one of the last big frontiers. The possibilities are exciting."</p><p>The possibilities include not just vegan cow cheese, but, well, vegan human cheese. The same basic process for synthesizing cow's milk applies to milk from any other mammal. You just need different genes. Cheese made from engineered human breast milk may not sound like a top seller at the deli counter. But the team says it can serve a practical purpose: Human milk cheese could offer an option to people who have allergies to non-human dairy products. (Chavez said the group has put its experiments with human milk on hold due to Food and Drug Administration concerns about possible autoimmune reactions.)</p></div></blockquote><p>The team is also attempting to create a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narwhal">narwhal</a> cheese, after achieving the <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/real-vegan-cheese">stretch goal</a> on Indiegogo. The recipe and <a href="https://wiki.realvegancheese.org/index.php/Shared_Laboratory_Notebook">experiments</a> involved will be released as "open source"; the DNA sequence(s) will be submitted to <a href="http://parts.igem.org/Main_Page">iGEM's Registry of Standard Biological Parts</a>.</p><p>Critics of <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2014/10/03/353024980/gmos-are-old-hat-synthetically-modified-food-is-the-new-frontier">synthetic foods</a> worry about the use of GMOs and the lightly regulated nature of biotechnology labs and hackerspaces. The Real Vegan Cheese team notes that the cheese itself isn't a GMO, only the yeast is. Other recent forays into synthetic food include Muufri's <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/muufri-test-tube-milk-2014-10">synthetic milk</a>, and Evolva's <a href="http://www.evolva.com/products">vanilla/vanillin and saffron substitutes</a>.</p><p><a href="https://soylentnews.org/article.pl?sid=15/04/17/1128204&amp;from=rss">Read more of this story</a> at SoylentNews.</p>]]></description>

The research indicates that we produce chemical compounds, or chemosignals, when we experience happiness that are detectable by others who smell our sweat.<br>...<br>For the second part of the study, the researchers recruited 36 Caucasian females, with no psychological disorder, respiratory disease, or other illness. The researchers note that only females were included in this part of the study as women generally have both a better sense of smell and a greater sensitivity to emotional signals than men do. The study was double-blind, such that neither the researcher nor the participant knew which sweat sample the participant would be exposed to at the time of the experiment.<br>...<br>Facial expression data revealed that women who were exposed to "fear sweat" showed greater activity in the medial frontalis muscle, a common feature of fear expressions. And women who were exposed to "happy sweat" showed more facial muscle activity indicative of a Duchenne smile, a common component of happiness expressions. There was no observable association, however, between the women's facial responses and their explicit ratings of how pleasant and intense the sweat was.</p></div></blockquote><p>So those dirty socks you were wearing when you won that epic Ultimate Frisbee finale?

<title>Physicists Spy on Random Motion of Electrons with Defective Diamonds</title>
<link>https://soylentnews.org/article.pl?sid=15/04/16/2059213&amp;from=rss</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p class="byline"> <a href="mailto:spowell@climafy.com">Phoenix666</a> writes:</p><p>Scientists have found a way to <a href="http://arstechnica.com/science/2015/04/diamonds-are-a-physicists-best-friend/">study finer details of electron motion</a> through a material using flawed diamonds:</p><blockquote><div><p>researchers studied Johnson noise, otherwise known as white noise. In a metal, there is a sea of electrons that is free to travel around in constant motion—the fact that the temperature is above absolute zero is enough to keep electrons in motion. Because of this motion, the density of electrons varies slightly from place to place at any given time. These fluctuations create small attractive and repulsive forces that drive electrons to attempt to neutralize the fields. In doing so, they create new density fluctuations and fields in an endlessly repeating cycle.<br>...<br>How could you possibly observe this behavior in detail? Using impure diamonds, as it turns out. I've discussed nitrogen vacancies in diamond in the past. Essentially, a carbon atom likes to be surrounded by four other carbon atoms. Nitrogen, on the other hand, only likes to have three atoms around it. If nitrogen is substituted for one of the carbon atoms, it cruelly rejects one of its neighbors. The electron proffered by the carbon atom is left stranded between a cold and uninviting nitrogen atom and a carbon atom that would sooner be rid of it. The nature of these surroundings gives the electron a very well-defined energy level structure, creating what is called an NV- center.</p></div></blockquote><p>The technique is thought to have practical relevance for the design and fabrication of semiconductor circuits.</p><p><a href="https://soylentnews.org/article.pl?sid=15/04/16/2059213&amp;from=rss">Read more of this story</a> at SoylentNews.</p>]]></description>

<title>Microsoft Relishes its Role as Accuser in Antitrust Suit Against Google</title>
<link>https://soylentnews.org/article.pl?sid=15/04/16/2050243&amp;from=rss</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p class="byline"> <a href="http://hughpickens.com/">Hugh Pickens</a> writes:</p><p>Danny Hakim reports at the NYT that as European antitrust regulators formally accuse Google of abusing its dominance, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/16/technology/microsoft-once-an-antitrust-target-is-now-googles-regulatory-scold.html">Microsoft is relishing playing a behind-the-scenes role of scold instead of victim</a>. Microsoft has founded or funded a cottage industry of splinter groups to go after Google. The most prominent, the Initiative for a Competitive Online Marketplace, or Icomp, has waged a relentless public relations campaign promoting grievances against Google. It conducted a study that <a href="http://www.i-comp.org/blog/2013/icomp-announces-results-of-new-eye-tracking-study/">suggested changes made by Google to appease regulators were largely window dressing</a>. “Microsoft is doing its best to create problems for Google,” says Manfred Weber, the chairman of the European People’s Party, the center-right party that is the largest voting bloc in the European Parliament. “It’s interesting. Ten years ago Microsoft was a big and strong company. Now they are the underdog.”<br> <br>

According to Hakim, Microsoft and Google are the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cain_and_Abel">Cain and Abel</a> of American technology, locked in the kind of struggle that often takes place when a new giant threatens an older one. Microsoft was frustrated after American regulators at the Federal Trade Commission didn’t act on a <a href="http://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2013/01/03/the-ftc-and-google-a-missed-opportunity/">similar antitrust investigation against Google in 2013, calling it a “missed opportunity.”</a> It has taken the fight to the state level, along with a number of other opponents of Google. Microsoft alleges that Google's anti-competitive practices include <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/mar/31/microsoft-google-anti-trust-complaint">stopping Bing from indexing content on Google-owned YouTube</a>; blocking Microsoft Windows smartphones from "operating properly" with YouTube; blocking access to content owned by book publishers; and limiting the flow of ad campaign information back to advertisers, making it more expensive to run ads with rivals. "Over the past year, a growing number of advertisers, publishers, and consumers have expressed to us their concerns about the search market in Europe," says Brad Smith, Microsoft's general counsel. "They've <a href="http://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2011/03/30/adding-our-voice-to-concerns-about-search-in-europe/">urged us to share our knowledge of the search market with competition officials</a>."</p><p><a href="https://soylentnews.org/article.pl?sid=15/04/16/2050243&amp;from=rss">Read more of this story</a> at SoylentNews.</p>]]></description>

<title>Gravity Payments: CEO Takes Cut and Makes $70k/year New Minimum Salary</title>
<link>https://soylentnews.org/article.pl?sid=15/04/16/1932231&amp;from=rss</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p class="byline">coagen (#debianfork on irc.freenode.net) writes:</p><p>"Is anyone else freaking out right now? I'm kind of freaking out." said Dan Price, the CEO of Seattle-based Gravity Payments, as he announced that the new minimum salary for current employees will be raised to $70,000 a year. Price is taking a pay cut from $1 million to $70,000 and spending an appreciable amount of the company's profit to raise annual salaries from the current average of $48,000.</p><p>From the <a href="http://mobile.nytimes.com/2015/04/14/business/owner-of-gravity-payments-a-credit-card-processor-is-setting-a-new-minimum-wage-70000-a-year.html">article</a>:</p><blockquote><div><p>The United States has one of the world's largest pay gaps, with chief executives earning nearly 300 times what the average worker makes, according to some economists' estimates. That is much higher than the 20-to-1 ratio recommended by Gilded Age magnates like J. Pierpont Morgan and the 20th century management visionary Peter Drucker.</p><p>[...] Under a financial overhaul passed by Congress in 2010, the Securities and Exchange Commission was supposed to require all publicly held companies to disclose the ratio of C.E.O. pay to the median pay of all other employees, but it has so far failed to put it in effect. Corporate executives have vigorously opposed the idea, complaining it would be cumbersome and costly to implement.</p><p>[...] The <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/107/38/16489.full">happiness research</a> behind Mr. Price's announcement on Monday came from Angus Deaton and Daniel Kahneman, a Nobel Prize-winning psychologist. They found that what they called emotional well-being — defined as "the emotional quality of an individual's everyday experience, the frequency and intensity of experiences of joy, stress, sadness, anger, and affection that make one's life pleasant or unpleasant" — rises with income, but only to a point. And that point turns out to be about $75,000 a year.</p></div></blockquote><p><a href="https://soylentnews.org/article.pl?sid=15/04/16/1932231&amp;from=rss">Read more of this story</a> at SoylentNews.</p>]]></description>

Researchers have thought about using such so-called tensegrity structures for some time, but have lacked complex computer algorithms that can model how they work, but that's now available and the results are encouraging, said Agogino.</p></div></blockquote><p><a href="https://soylentnews.org/article.pl?sid=15/04/16/1137204&amp;from=rss">Read more of this story</a> at SoylentNews.</p>]]></description>

<li>
Weak administrator passwords such as "admin" or "abcde"

Use of an embedded version of Windows XP which hasn't been updated since 2004
</li><li>
Use of WEP for Wifi encryption

Worse still, this machine has been used in actual elections and its lack of any logging or record-keeping means that we'll never know if its weaknesses were used to manipulate the outcome of an election.

<title>A Singapore Math Problem Goes Viral: When Is Cheryl&#x2019;s Birthday?</title>
<link>https://soylentnews.org/article.pl?sid=15/04/16/004243&amp;from=rss</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p class="byline"> <a href="http://hughpickens.com/">Hugh Pickens</a> writes:</p><p>A couple of months ago, it was a color-changing dress that blew out the neural circuits of the Internet. Now Kenneth Chang reports in the NYT that a problem from a math olympiad test for math-savvy high school-age students in Singapore is <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/15/science/answer-to-the-singapore-math-problem-cheryl-birthday.html">making the rounds on the internet that has perplexed puzzle problem solvers</a> as they grapple with the simple question: "So when is Cheryl's birthday?"</p><blockquote><div><p>Albert and Bernard just met Cheryl. “When’s your birthday?” Albert asked Cheryl.<br>

Cheryl thought a second and said, “I’m not going to tell you, but I’ll give you some clues.” She wrote down a list of 10 dates:<br>

May 15 — May 16 — May 19<br>

June 17 — June 18<br>

July 14 — July 16<br>

August 14 — August 15 — August 17<br>

“My birthday is one of these,” she said.<br>

Then Cheryl whispered in Albert’s ear the month — and only the month — of her birthday. To Bernard, she whispered the day, and only the day. <br>

“Can you figure it out now?” she asked Albert.<br>

Albert: I don’t know when your birthday is, but I know Bernard doesn’t know, either.<br>

Bernard: I didn’t know originally, but now I do.<br>

Albert: Well, now I know, too!<br>

When is Cheryl’s birthday?</p></div></blockquote><p>

Logical puzzles like this are common in Singapore. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_math">Singapore math curriculum, which has a strong focus on logic-based problem solving</a>, has been so successful that it's been adopted around the world. According to Terrance F. Ross, US students have made strides in math proficiency in recent years, but they still lag behind many of their peers internationally, falling at the middle of the pack in global rankings. In the same PISA report the U.S. placed 35th out of 64 countries in math. "And even though the "Cheryl's Birthday" question may be atypical of the average Singaporean classroom, perhaps it's still worth asking: <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2015/04/the-math-question-that-went-viral/390411/">Are you smarter than a (Singaporean) 10th-grader?</a>"</p><p><a href="https://soylentnews.org/article.pl?sid=15/04/16/004243&amp;from=rss">Read more of this story</a> at SoylentNews.</p>]]></description>

The system, made by Moley Robotics in the UK, can only make crab bisque right now—and it requires that all of the ingredients and utensils are pre-positioned perfectly. The goal, though, is to have a consumer-ready version within two years, priced at around £10,000 ($14,600). The company envisions an "iTunes style library of recipes" that you can download and have your robot chef prepare.</p><p>In its current form, the Moley Robotic Kitchen is essentially two very expensive robotic arms, with two even dearer fully articulated biomimetic humanoid hands made by the Shadow Robot Company on the ends. In front of the robot is a kitchen—a sink, a stovetop, an oven, and a range of utensils, including the aforementioned blender. The ingredients are placed in bowls and cups on the worktop.

The dark matter in Abell 3827 bent the path of light rays coming from a distant background galaxy, which happened to be aligned just right for the team's purpose.<br> <br>The researchers found that one dark matter clump appeared to be lagging behind the galaxy it surrounds.

<title>The Surprising Downsides of Being Clever</title>
<link>https://soylentnews.org/article.pl?sid=15/04/15/126231&amp;from=rss</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p class="byline"> <a href="//soylentnews.org/~AnonTechie/">AnonTechie</a> writes:</p><p> <a href="http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20150413-the-downsides-of-being-clever">From BBC Future</a>:</p><blockquote><div><p>If ignorance is bliss, does a high IQ equal misery? Popular opinion would have it so. We tend to think of geniuses as being plagued by existential angst, frustration, and loneliness. Think of Virginia Woolf, Alan Turing, or Lisa Simpson – lone stars, isolated even as they burn their brightest. As Ernest Hemingway wrote: "Happiness in intelligent people is the rarest thing I know."</p><p>The question may seem like a trivial matter concerning a select few – but the insights it offers could have ramifications for many. Much of our education system is aimed at improving academic intelligence; although its limits are well known, IQ is still the primary way of measuring cognitive abilities, and we spend millions on brain training and cognitive enhancers that try to improve those scores. But what if the quest for genius is itself a fool's errand?</p><p>The first steps to answering these questions were taken almost a century ago, at the height of the American Jazz Age. At the time, the new-fangled IQ test was gaining traction, after proving itself in World War One recruitment centres, and in 1926, psychologist Lewis Terman decided to use it to identify and study a group of gifted children. Combing California's schools for the creme de la creme, he selected 1,500 pupils with an IQ of 140 or more – 80 of whom had IQs above 170. Together, they became known as the "Termites", and the highs and lows of their lives are still being studied to this day.</p><p>As you might expect, many of the Termites did achieve wealth and fame – most notably Jess Oppenheimer, the writer of the classic 1950s sitcom I Love Lucy. Indeed, by the time his series aired on CBS, the Termites' average salary was twice that of the average white-collar job. But not all the group met Terman's expectations – there were many who pursued more "humble" professions such as police officers, seafarers, and typists. For this reason, Terman concluded that "intellect and achievement are far from perfectly correlated". Nor did their smarts endow personal happiness. Over the course of their lives, levels of <a href="https://alumni.stanford.edu/get/page/magazine/article/?article_id=40678">divorce, alcoholism and suicide</a> were about the same as the national average.</p><p>As the Termites enter their dotage, the moral of their story – that intelligence does not equate to a better life – has been told again and again. At best, a great intellect makes no differences to your life satisfaction; at worst, <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15427609.2014.936182#.VR1XHRCtaFE">it can actually mean you are less fulfilled</a>.</p></div></blockquote><p><a href="https://soylentnews.org/article.pl?sid=15/04/15/126231&amp;from=rss">Read more of this story</a> at SoylentNews.</p>]]></description>

Competition commissions in India, Russia, Brazil, Argentina, Taiwan and Canada have opened investigations - the US commission dropped its probe in 2013 after Google agreed to several non-binding commitments.

Though nearly indistinguishable in normal optical frequencies, the differences became apparent when examined in the ultraviolet. The significance is two type IA supernovae having the same luminosity may actually be located at different distances from us. This, in turn, calls into question how fast the universe is expanding.</p><p>So, if I measured the brightness of a "100-watt bulb" at 1km, and then measure another "100-watt bulb" and find it to have the same brightness, I would assume that it, too, was 1km away. Apparently some "100-watt bulbs" are dimmer than others &mdash; and, according to the inverse square law, would be closer to me than 1 km.</p><p>I've been unable to determine how much a difference this would cause in our estimation of the rate of the expansion of the universe. Also, I suspect this might affect our 3-D maps of the universe and what is located where. How will it affect the current thinking about "dark energy"? How much of an impact are we looking at here?

<title>Violent Methane Storms on Titan May Solve Dune Direction Mystery</title>

As the Cassini-Huygens spacecraft examines Titan, its discoveries bring new mysteries. One of these is that the seemingly wind-created sand dunes spotted near the moon's equator point one direction, but the near-surface winds point another direction. Astronomers may have solved this mystery. <br>
...</p><p>Here's the problem: Climate simulations indicate that Titan's near-surface winds -- like Earth's trade winds -- blow toward the west. So why do the surface dunes, reaching a hundred yards high and many miles long, point to the east? <br>
...</p><p>Violent methane storms high in Titan's dense atmosphere, where winds do blow toward the east, might be the answer, according to new research by University of Washington astronomer Benjamin Charnay and co-authors in a <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.03404">paper published today in the journal Nature Geoscience</a>.

Using computer models, Charnay, a UW post-doctoral researcher, and co-authors hypothesize that the attitude of Titan's sand dunes results from rare methane storms that produce eastward gusts much stronger than the usual westward surface winds.</p></div></blockquote><p>Will we one day discover Titanians wind-surfing the seas of methane?</p><p><a href="https://soylentnews.org/article.pl?sid=15/04/14/2342204&amp;from=rss">Read more of this story</a> at SoylentNews.</p>]]></description>

<title>Fifty Years of Moore&#x27;s Law</title>
<link>https://soylentnews.org/article.pl?sid=15/04/14/1926256&amp;from=rss</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p class="byline"> <a href="http://hughpickens.com/">Hugh Pickens</a> writes:</p><p>IEEE is running a <a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/static/special-report-50-years-of-moores-law">special report on "50 Years of Moore's Law"</a> that considers "the gift that keeps on giving" from different points of view. Chris Mack begins by arguing that <a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/semiconductors/processors/the-multiple-lives-of-moores-law">nothing about Moore’s Law was inevitable</a>. "Instead, it’s a testament to hard work, human ingenuity, and the incentives of a free market. Moore’s prediction may have started out as a fairly simple observation of a young industry. But over time it became an expectation and self-fulfilling prophecy—an ongoing act of creation by engineers and companies that saw the benefits of Moore’s Law and did their best to keep it going, or else risk falling behind the competition." <br> <br>

Andrew Huang argues that Moore's Law is slowing and will someday stop but <a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/semiconductors/design/the-death-of-moores-law-will-spur-innovation">the death of Moore's Law will spur innovation</a>. "Someday in the foreseeable future, you will not be able to buy a better computer next year," writes Huang. "Under such a regime, you’ll probably want to purchase things that are more nicely made to begin with. The idea of an “heirloom laptop” may sound preposterous today, but someday we may perceive our computers as cherished and useful looms to hand down to our children, much as some people today regard wristwatches or antique furniture."<br> <br>

Vaclav Smil writes about "Moore's Curse" and argues that <a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/energy/renewables/moores-curse">there is a dark side to the revolution in electronics</a> for it has had the unintended effect of raising expectations for technical progress. "We are assured that rapid progress will soon bring self-driving electric cars, hypersonic airplanes, individually tailored cancer cures, and instant three-dimensional printing of hearts and kidneys. We are even told it will pave the world’s transition from fossil fuels to renewable energies," writes Smil. "But the doubling time for transistor density is no guide to technical progress generally. Modern life depends on many processes that improve rather slowly, not least the production of food and energy and the transportation of people and goods."<br> <br>

Finally Cyrus Mody writes that it  seems clear that Moore’s Law is not a law of nature in any commonly accepted sense but what kind of thing is Moore’s Law? "<a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/semiconductors/devices/what-kind-of-thing-is-moores-law">Moore’s Law is a human construct</a>. As with legislation, though, most of us have little and only indirect say in its construction," writes Mody. "Everyone, both the producers and consumers of microelectronics, takes steps needed to maintain Moore’s Law, yet everyone’s experience is that they are subject to it."</p><p><a href="https://soylentnews.org/article.pl?sid=15/04/14/1926256&amp;from=rss">Read more of this story</a> at SoylentNews.</p>]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[<p class="byline"> <a href="//soylentnews.org/~takyon/">takyon</a> writes:</p><p>Sharp has announced its intention to manufacture the <a href="http://www.tomshardware.com/news/sharp-4k-display-smartphone-trade-offs,28915.html">world's sharpest display</a>, a 5.5" <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indium_gallium_zinc_oxide">IGZO</a> screen with a 4K/UHD 3840x2160 resolution (806 pixels per inch), for some 2016 smartphones. Is 806 PPI too much? Tom's Hardware notes the drawbacks while celebrating the new milestone:</p><blockquote><div><p>Although devices that are 1440p or even 4K will look even more stunning, there are indeed diminishing returns benefits-wise as the cost, the power consumption, or the GPU resources required to handle such high resolutions are significantly higher than the previous generations.</p><p>That's not to say that a 4K display today will necessarily cost more than a 1440p display did last year, but it does cost significantly more than a 1440p display being sold this year. Although the price ratios for components may remain relatively the same for the new technologies inside a new smartphone, if the benefits are increasingly smaller, then there's an opportunity cost, as well.</p><p>For instance, the extra cost to get a 4K display over a 1440p display this year could be used instead towards improving the device's camera. (OEMs could use a sharper lens, a larger sensor, improved OIS, and so on.) This sort of balance should always be taken into consideration.</p><p>[...] That doesn't mean higher resolution displays in smartphones are not useful. However, they could be even more useful for other applications; for example, 4K displays are ideal for VR. In order to have a VR experience that makes you completely forget you have a screen in front of your eyes, you'll need at least a 4K resolution screen.</p><p>Higher-resolution displays will also help lower the cost of lower resolution panels.</p></div></blockquote><p><a href="https://soylentnews.org/article.pl?sid=15/04/14/1437244&amp;from=rss">Read more of this story</a> at SoylentNews.</p>]]></description>

This is something we saw on Intel architectures for a while, and it seems to be working just fine. This will be the first exciting processor from the house of AMD in the server / HSA market in years, and in case AMD delivers it on time it might be a big break for the company.<br> <br>Each Zen core gets 512 KB of L2 cache and each cluster or four Zen cores is sharing 8MB L3 cache. In case we are talking about a 16-core, 32-thread next generation Zen based x86 processor, the total amount of L2 cache gets to a whopping 8MB, backed by 32MB of L3 cache.<br> <br>This new APU also comes with the Greenland Graphics and Multimedia Engine that comes with HBM memory on the side. The specs we saw indicate that there can be up to 16GB of HBM memory with 512GB/s speed packed on the interposer. This is definitely a lot of memory for an APU GPU, and it also comes with 1/2 rate double precision compute, enhanced ECC and RAS and HSA support.</p></div></blockquote><p>The new APU sports quad-channel DDR4 support, with up to 256GB per channel at speeds of up to 3.2GHz. No information yet on which processor socket this APU will use, but it's safe to assume the DDR4 support alone will render it incompatible with all AMD's current motherboards.

<title>&#x27;Urban Death Project&#x27; Proposes to Compost the Dead</title>
<link>https://soylentnews.org/article.pl?sid=15/04/14/024256&amp;from=rss</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p class="byline"> <a href="http://hughpickens.com/">Hugh Pickens</a> writes:</p><p>Even as more people opt for interment in simple shrouds or biodegradable caskets, urban cemeteries continue to fill up and cremation is a problematic option for the environmentally conscious, as the process releases greenhouse gases.  Now Catrin Einhorn reports at the NYT that architect Katrina Spade has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/14/science/a-project-to-turn-corpses-into-compost.html">designed a facility for human composting</a> that is attracting interest from environmental advocates and scientists. “Composting makes people think of banana peels and coffee grounds,” says Spade. But “our bodies have nutrients. What if we could grow new life after we’ve died?” The <a href="http://www.urbandeathproject.org/">Urban Death Project's plans call for a three-story-high polished concrete composting structure</a> in Seattle called "the core," which would be surrounded by contemplative spaces for visitors. After a ceremony - religious or not - friends and family would help insert the body into the core. <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/12/15/us-usa-composting-seattle-idUSKBN0JT1BY20141215">Over several weeks a body would turn into about one cubic yard of compost</a>, enough to plant a tree or a patch of flowers.</p><p>

For most people in the US, <a href="http://grist.org/living/how-human-composting-will-change-death-in-the-city/">there are two options after death: You are buried or you are burned</a>. The costs, both environmental and financial, are significant, but we accept these options because they are all that we know. Conventional burial is anything but natural. Cadavers are preserved with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embalming#Modern_practices">embalming fluid containing formaldehyde, a carcinogen</a> then buried in caskets made of metal or wood, and placed inside a concrete or metal burial vault. The tradition of <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/apr/2/the-father-of-modern-embalming/?page=all">embalming in the United States is relatively new, beginning in the Civil War</a> when northern families needed to get their dead men home from the South. Spade  understands the idea of human composting may be icky to some, but it’s an important part of her concept, the thing that differentiates it from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_burial">natural burial, which requires extensive land</a>. "I’m sure I’ll continue to get pushback, but I’ll continue to be stubborn because I think it’s really important that we’re part of a larger ecosystem.”</p><p><a href="https://soylentnews.org/article.pl?sid=15/04/14/024256&amp;from=rss">Read more of this story</a> at SoylentNews.</p>]]></description>
